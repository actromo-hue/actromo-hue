°✩. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.Hi! I'm Alexa, an aerospace engineering student.
I like reading, the outdoors, cute things, eating sweets, and learning about how things work.✮ ⋆ ˚｡𖦹 ⋆｡°✩

I can work well both individually and with others and am a good problem solver when uncertainties arise. I am patient and persevering when it comes to projects that may take time. I am also confident in my ability to do research and learn rapidly during hands-on projects. ⋆.˚ ☾ .⭒˚
